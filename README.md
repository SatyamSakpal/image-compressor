# Image Compressor with Multi-Image Compression 


This is a JavaScript-based image compression tool that allows you to compress multiple images simultaneously using the Sharp module and then packages them into a zip archive using the Archiver module. Whether you're optimizing images for web applications or reducing file sizes for storage, this tool can help you achieve efficient compression with ease.

## Features

- **Batch Image Compression:** Compress multiple images at once, saving you time and effort.
- **Image Size:** Reduces the size of an image to approximately 72% without visible quality drop.
- **High-Quality Compression:** Utilizes the Sharp module to ensure minimal loss of image quality during compression.
- **Zip Archiving:** Automatically packages the compressed images into a zip file for convenient download and storage.
